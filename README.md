# How to play:

The objective of the game is to beat the dealer. To beat the dealer, the sum of the cards in your hand will need to be greater than the sum of the cards in the dealer's hand, without being over 21. If you reach a sum over 21, you lose. If the dealer reaches a sum over 21 (and you have not), then you win.
